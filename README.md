# ArithBinator

**ArithBinator** is an advanced arithmetic and binary calculator developed by Divan. This application allows users to perform various operations on numbers in different number systems, including binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal. It features a user-friendly interface built with PyQt5, providing a seamless experience for conversions, binary operations, logical operations, and now **Multiplexer (MUX)** and **Demultiplexer (DEMUX)** functionality.

## Features

- **Number Conversion**: Convert numbers between binary, decimal, octal, and hexadecimal.
- **Binary Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on binary numbers.
- **Complement Operations**: Calculate the first and second complements of binary numbers.
- **BCD Operations**: Convert between decimal and Binary-Coded Decimal (BCD).
- **Logic Gates**: Execute logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR) on binary inputs.
- **Multiplexer (MUX)**: Select one of multiple binary inputs based on select lines and output the result.
- **Demultiplexer (DEMUX)**: Route a single binary input to one of many outputs based on select lines.
- **Help Section**: Access guidance on how to use the application effectively.
- **About Section**: Learn more about the application and its developer.

## Usage
